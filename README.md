 Any mods made with this will probably get withheld for being low quality.<br>
 This will always make the stage set to "Stage" and the character icon to Pico for any charts missing a config<br>
 This wipes the songs.txt every time it's run.<br>
 Songs will usually be listed in reverse alphabetical order.<br>
 
# Adding a Chart

 (/'s stand for a folder for example mods/charts means the charts folder in your mods folder)<br>
 To add charts, make a new folder named the song in your mods/charts folder, grab the chart from the mod(Commonly found under the Data/SONGSNAME folder) and then paste it into the folder you created.<br>
 Copy the Inst and Voices into the folder(Or copy the SONGNAME_Voices and SONGNAME_Inst to the main charts folder and the script will handle it)<br>
 Run the script and then check your game<br>
 You can disable charts by adding a ! to it's name and the script will ignore it<br>
 If the chart skips randomly and there's no song then make sure to have the Inst and Voices as OGG files and that they're in the folder for the chart<br>

This tool is not garrenteed to work with all charts. Some charts may crash the game or be unusable with the Multiplayer mod<br>
